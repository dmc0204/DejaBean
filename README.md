# DejaNuz

# This is an early version of DejaNuz.

  DejaNuz lets you add your favorite news sites to a list and evaluate them based on a search term. 
It allows you to select the best candidate for your viewing interest and go directly to the site of interest (avoiding unwanted advertisments and content).

Deja_B is the published program and with all dependencies.

Netbeans v8.2 IDE was used to write this application. The Netbeans project files are in the DejaNuz directory.

There is a more robust version of DejaNuz that is a webcrawler that datamines and evaluates a whole domain to find targeted content. That version includes DejaNuz, DejaDrill, DejaVu and DejaJump functions.
