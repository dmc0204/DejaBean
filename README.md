# DejaNuz

# This is an early version of DejaNuz.

##   DejaNuz lets you add your favorite news sites to a list and evaluate them based on a search term. 
## It allows you to select the best candidate for your viewing interest and go directly to the site of interest (avoiding unwanted advertisments and content).

Deja_B is the published program and with all dependencies.

The Netbeans v8.2 was used to write this application.
